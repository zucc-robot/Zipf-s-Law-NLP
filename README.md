Project Description: Analysis of Zipf’s Law using graphical and numerical
tools in Python.

Libraries and Packages used:

1) re: A regular expression (or RE) specifies a set of strings that matches
it; the functions in this module let you check if a particular string matches
a given regular expression (or if a given regular expression matches a
particular string, which comes down to the same thing).

2) numpy: NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in
Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array
object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and
an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including
mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete
Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations,
random simulation and much more.

3) scipy: SciPy is a collection of mathematical algorithms and convenience
functions built on the NumPy extension of Python. It adds significant
power to the interactive Python session by providing the user with
high-level commands and classes for manipulating and visualizing data.
With SciPy, an interactive Python session becomes a data-processing and
system-prototyping environment rivaling systems, such as MATLAB, IDL,
Octave, R-Lab, and SciLab.

4) collections: This module implements specialized container datatypes
providing alternatives to Python’s general purpose built-in containers, dict,
list, set, and tuple.

5) operator: The operator module exports a set of efficient functions
corresponding to the intrinsic operators of Python. For example,
operator.add(x, y) is equivalent to the expression x+y. Many function
names are those used for special methods, without the double underscores.
For backward compatibility, many of these have a variant with the double
underscores kept. The variants without the double underscores are
preferred for clarity.

6) os: This module provides a portable way of using operating system
2
dependent functionality. If you just want to read or write a file see open(),
if you want to manipulate paths, see the os.path module, and if you want
to read all the lines in all the files on the command line see the fileinput
module. For creating temporary files and directories see the tempfile
module, and for high-level file and directory handling see the shutil module.

7) matplotlib: Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming
language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an
object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using
general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK+
